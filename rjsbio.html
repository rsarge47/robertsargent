                <p class="pigBlue">Robert Sargent was born in Roanoke Virginia, year 1983.  The year of the Water Pig according to Chinese astrology.  What does that mean!?!  Water pigs are born smart and adaptable, and they are good at speaking. Also, they are responsible and serious in work, but sometimes too subjective, dependent, and a little stubborn.</p>

                    <p>Growing up my main interests were team sports and video games.  I enjoyed baseball, basketball, football, and all types of video games!</p>
                    <p>I worked in Food and Beverage starting on the day of my 15th birthday.  Progressing my culinary career led me to Washington D.C. There I worked for several Chefs in fine dining establishments.  Willow Restaurant was where I met my wife Amanda.</p>
                    <p>Six months after being married to Amanda in November of 2013, we moved away from the capitol, and I stopped working in fine dining.  After becoming accustomed to a new lifestyle outside of the kitchen, I decided to attend UNCC Coding Bootcamp!</p>
